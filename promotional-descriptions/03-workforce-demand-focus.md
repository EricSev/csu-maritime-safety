# Meeting Critical Workforce Demand in Maritime Safety

**Version C - Employment & Market Focus**

---

Shipyards and marine terminals across the country face persistent staffing challenges—particularly for qualified safety professionals. CSU's Maritime Safety Concentration addresses this gap with four courses covering regulatory compliance, workers' compensation law, emerging technologies, and cargo handling operations. Developed with Signal Mutual members, this curriculum prepares candidates for safety roles at shipbuilding facilities, repair yards, and port operations nationwide. From Hampton Roads to the Gulf Coast to the Pacific Northwest, employers need professionals who understand maritime-specific hazards and regulations. Position yourself for opportunities in an undersupplied field where trained safety talent remains in high demand.
