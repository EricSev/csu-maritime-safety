# Bridging the Maritime Safety Talent Gap

**Version E - Industry Challenge & Solution**

---

From Navy shipyards to commercial terminals, maritime employers struggle to find safety professionals with industry-specific knowledge. Traditional programs don't address Jones Act compliance, ship construction hazards, or maritime cargo operations—leaving a critical workforce gap. CSU's Maritime Safety Concentration fills this void with four targeted courses developed alongside Signal Mutual members who identified exactly what employers need. Graduates understand regulatory frameworks, risk management strategies, and operational realities unique to maritime environments. As the industry invests in new facilities and equipment, trained safety personnel become essential. Prepare for high-demand roles where your specialized expertise makes an immediate impact.
